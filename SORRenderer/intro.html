  <p>Hello! This site is very much a work in progress, feel free to look around!</p>

		<h1>Instructions:</h1>
		<p>
			1. Click "Create New SOR"<br>
			2. Left click in the canvas to start a line<br>
			3. Continue to left click to add as many points as you'd like.<br>
			4. Right click to add the terminate the line at the pointer's location. It will now be rotated about the y-axis and rendered.<br>
			Now you can use WASD to move the camera and the arrow keys to turn.<br>
			You can render multiple objects but they generate on top of each other in the current build.<br>

      Newly Added: You can click and drag SOR objects to move them around the scene.<br>
      While clicking you can use '-' and '=' to move the object closer or further from you.<br>
      If you hold ctrl while dragging and object it will be rotated.
			<br>
			NOTE: This was originally created for a college course. I started re-writing it from scratch for organizational reasons.<br>
			The current implementation is missing features such as texture mapping
			and additional light sources (among other things). <br>
			Those will be re-implemented in due time.<br>
