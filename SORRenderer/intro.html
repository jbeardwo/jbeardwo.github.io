<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<p>
	1. Click "Create New SOR"<br>
	2. Left click in the canvas to start a line<br>
	3. Continue to left click to add as many points as you'd like.<br>
	4. Right click on your final point to terminate your line, it will now be rotated about the y-axis and rendered.<br>
	Now you can use WASD to move the camera and the arrow keys to turn.<br>
	You can render multiple objects but they generate on top of each other in the current build.<br>
	<br>
	NOTE: This was originally created for a college course. I started re-writing it from scratch for organizational reasons.<br>
	The current implementation is missing features such as moving objects with the mouse as well as texture mapping
	and additional light sources. <br>
	Those will be added back in as time progresses.<br>
