          Hello! I am a programmer and musician currently living in Santa Cruz, CA.<br>
          I am a lifelong multi-instrumentalist who mainly focuses on guitar, drums, and saxophone.<br>
          While I am most experienced playing Alternative, Jazz, and Mathrock,
          I love learning about and playing music of all kinds.<br>
          As a longtime fan of complex logical systems
          I am fascinated by the cascading effects that small changes can have within them.<br>
          This has led to my current enthusiasm for creating functional tools, especially interactive ones. (Check out the Projects section)<br>
          Outside of computers and music I am very into games (especially Super Smash Brothers Melee)
          and skateboard relatively frequently.<br>
          <br>
          If you'd like to take a look at my professional resume, it is available <a href=./Resources/pdf/resumecurrent.pdf>here</a>
